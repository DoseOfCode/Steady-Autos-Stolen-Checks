## Issues

At the heart, this data is stored by the New Zealand Transport Agency & is sycned with the NZ Police during rolling periods over the day.  There **will** be delays with vehicles being includes if they are recently stolen, up to 8 hours.  If you require a more accurate database, use the New Zealand Transport Agency's [Motochek](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/vehicles/how-the-motor-vehicle-register-affects-you/requesting-register-information/motochek/what-is-motochek/) service, where the police update directly.
